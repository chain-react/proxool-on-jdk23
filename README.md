proxool-on-jdk23
---

A Java SQL Driver that provides a connection pool wrapper

## Features

- It can run on any version between JDK 1.4 and JDK 23.0
- It does not depend on any third-party JAR libraries
- The package name, class name, and interface name are exactly the same as the old `proxool` library; so, all you need to do is replace the JAR file

## Note

The original author of the Proxool is Bill Horsman, see the [Author Site](https://github.com/proxool/proxool)
